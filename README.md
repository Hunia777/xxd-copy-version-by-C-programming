xxd instruction copy practice
=============================

### XXD shows the binary file to hexadecimal, memory information and character information
    Normal way to use "xxd"
    In terminal(Linux or MAC), Just input "xxd <filename>"

### hxxd shows the binary file to hexadecimal, and character information.
    By using file instruction in C programming, I can open the file by binary option.
    Just read the file, and print it out by hexadecimal option -> printf("%X",<var>);

### Any question for hxxd?
